# TicTacToeGame-
This Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a back-end-only implementation using Core Java, focusing on game logic, rule enforcement, and efficient data handling without any graphical interface. It runs in a console environment, allowing two players to take turns marking a 3x3 grid. The program validates moves, checks for a winner, and ensures a fair game.
